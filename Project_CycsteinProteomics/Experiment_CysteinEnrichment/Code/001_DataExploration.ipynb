    "\"Final_Data\" sheet\n",
    "Summary: This is the data that made it through some of the filtering steps that we included in the data processing software I am using. Essentially, we ask that a peptide be identified in 3/4 MS runs included for the experiment. In some cases, this filter is applied during the processing steps such that all peptides in the \"Final_Data\" sheet meet this 3/4 requirement. In other cases, the filter was not applied, and we will need to apply that filter ourselves here (apologies for the inconsistencies here!). In any case, it would be good practice to make sure that this filter is applied to all of them before moving forward with any analysis. If this \"3/4 requirement\" isn't making a ton of sense yet, don't worry. I will go into that in more detail below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Column A: Identifier\n",
    "This column contains the ID for the specific cysteine we are detecting. This contains the uniprot protein ID for the protein that the cysteine-containing peptide is coming from, along with the cysteine residue position # in that protein. So if the protein is BTK, which has an accession number of Q06187, and the cysteine being detected on BTK is in position 481 of the protein, the  \"Identifier\" will be Q06187_C481.\n",
    "\n",
    "Column B: AltIdentifier\n",
    "This is the same as column A, but instead of the uniprot accession number being used, it's the protein name. So in our BTK example above, here it would be listed as BTK_C481.\n",
    "\n",
    "Column C: Modified_Peptide\n",
    "This is the sequence of the peptide that contains the cysteine being detected. Importantly, the cysteine that was tagged with our chemical probe is flagged with an asterisk. In some instances, residues here are followed by a number within brackets (i.e., [0.9840]). This is just the mass of a modification found on that residue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Columns D — G: Log2R/../../../../MS_RUN_ID\n",
    "These columns contain the Log2 Heavy/Light ratios for the peptides. We have biological duplicates of each cell line in the NCI60 (A and B). For each sample, we run it twice on the MS (1 and 2). So in total, we have 4 MS runs for each cell line (A1, B1, A2, B2). In order to have confidence in the peptides we are seeing in our data, we ask that a peptide be seen in 3 out of the 4 total MS runs here. Our reasoning is that by asking for a 3/4 requirement, we will end up with peptides that were ID'd in both biological duplicates (A and B) at least once. Any missing values in these columns simply indicate that the peptide was not detected in that particular run. \n",
    "\n",
    "Column H: Log2R_Average\n",
    "This one is just the average Log2 H/L ratio between the 4 MS runs associated with the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Filtered_Out\" sheet\n",
    "This is the same as above, but all peptides here failed to meet the minimum requirements (i.e., only found in 1/4 or 2/4 runs). We are not interested in any of these peptides."
